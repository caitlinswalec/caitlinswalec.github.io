### About Me

I am passionate about industrial decarbonization as a solution for a livable future on the planet I love to explore. I direct the Heavy Industry Program at [Global Energy Monitor](https://globalenergymonitor.org/), a nonprofit research organization, and teach [carbon accounting](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/caitlin-swalec) at the graduate-level at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Â My favorite ways to travel and explore our world are through [open water swimming](https://longswims.com/p/caitlin-swalec/) and [trail running](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Caitlin&lname=Swalec&age=30). You could say that I'm pursuing a high-carb lifestyle on a low-carb(on) planet.
