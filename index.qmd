I am an industrial decarbonization expert and climate change advocate. I direct the Heavy Industry Program at Global Energy Monitor, a nonprofit research organization, and teach graduate-level courses in carbon accounting at the University of California. I am also an experienced open water swimmer and trail runner, as well as a textile artist.
