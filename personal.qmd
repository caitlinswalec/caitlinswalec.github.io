My professional work on the climate movement is fueled by my personal passions for trail running, open water swimming, and fiber arts. While seeking adventure, discovery, and creation through these activities, I feel deeply connected to our planet and my community.

## Trail Running

My most recent trail running adventure was a [50 mile rim-to-rim-to-rim](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBW1yc3yFGqSeowjaJ6OsK4lQKf36UsPa36QsA0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) crossing of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA on October 9, 2024. The effort was solo, unassisted, and joyful. Four days later I ran the [Chicago Marathon](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBfJq-cSFQjBdQvJSz6FlhG7aEXEIcwn2H6RnI0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) with one of my best friends.

## Open Water Swimming

On October 3, 2023, I completed a 12.4 statute mile solo swim from Anacapa Island to Oxnard, California according to the marathon swimming rules of the [Santa Barbara Channel Swimming Association](https://www.instagram.com/sbchannelswim/p/C0UztrLyKFR/?img_index=1). My swim was featured for a [Waterwoman Wednesday](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Z4B5sJ9s1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) by Women in the Water.

## Fiber Arts

I enjoy knitting and crocheting and dream of one day having an entirely handmade closet of knitwear. I document my work on [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/cmswalec) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/glitterpathcrafts/).
